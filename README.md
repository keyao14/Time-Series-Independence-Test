# Time-Series-Independence-Test
WNModel.R generates the simulation data for one time series white noise test, WNTest.R implements the bootstrap test method applied to observed time series and differenced time series, and WNSimu.R performs the simulation with specified parameters.

CrossModel.R generates simulation data for two time series cross dependence test, CrossTest.R implements the bootstrap method applied to observed time series and differenced time series, and CrossSimu.R performs the simulation with specified parameters.

Datasets folder contains some real datasets that we applied our methods to analyze in RealDataTest.R
